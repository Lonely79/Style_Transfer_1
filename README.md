Environment
---------------------

Install the relevant environment according to the requirements.tx file
Because the VGG19 parameter file is relatively large, the resource has been put on CSDN for free, please put it under the vgg19 folder after downloading, please see the detailed address：


File description
-------
styleTransfer.py——The main program can be run directly to get the results, and the parameters can be changed according to personal needs
extract.py——Used to extract the feature map of each layer output of the Vgg19 network, which can be run directly to obtain the result
